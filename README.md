# Roman numeral converter code showing Single Responsiblity Principle

## Usage

1. Open the project.
2. Open a terminal in the container.
3. ``` bash
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./convert MCMXCIX
    ```

## Notes

- The converter does not validate: it converts IMI to 1002 which it shouldn't do.
